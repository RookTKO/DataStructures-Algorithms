## Time Complexity

Time complexity is the computational complexity that it takes for a program/function to iterate through the operations by the algorithms in that program.
### Big O
> Big O specifcally describes the upper bound of time, or **best case scenario**.
### Big Omega
> Big Omega descripes the opposite of Big O. It descripes the lowest bound of time, or **worst case scenario**.
### Big Theta
