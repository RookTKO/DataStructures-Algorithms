## Time Complexity

Time complexity is the computational complexity that it takes for a program/function to iterate through the operations by the algorithms in that program.
### Big O
> Big O specifcally describes the upper bound of time, or **best case scenario**.
### Big Omega
> Big Omega descripes the opposite of Big O. It descripes the lowest bound of time, or **worst case scenario**.
### Big Theta

## Algorithms

### Binary Search :
#### Description: 
Also known as **half-interval search**, **logarithmic search**, or **binary chop**. It is a search algorithm that finds the positon of a target value within a **_sorted_** array.
#### Functionality:
#### Performance:
+ Worst-Case time complexity: O(log n)
+ Best-case time complexity: O(1)
+ Worst-case space complexity: O(1)
